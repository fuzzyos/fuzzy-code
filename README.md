Fuzzy is a minimal terminal coding harness. Adapt fuzzy to your workflows, not the other way around, without having to fork and modify fuzzy internals. Extend it with TypeScript [Extensions](#extensions), [Skills](#skills), [Prompt Templates](#prompt-templates), and [Themes](#themes). Put your extensions, skills, prompt templates, and themes in [Fuzzy Packages](#fuzzy-packages) and share them with others via npm or git.

Fuzzy ships with powerful defaults but skips features like sub agents and plan mode. Instead, you can ask fuzzy to build what you want or install a third party fuzzy package that matches your workflow.

Fuzzy runs in four modes: interactive, print or JSON, RPC for process integration, and an SDK for embedding in your own apps. See [openclaw/openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) for a real-world SDK integration.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @fuzzyos/fuzzy-code
```

`--ignore-scripts` disables dependency lifecycle scripts during install. Fuzzy does not require install scripts for normal npm installs.

Installer alternative:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://fuzzyos.com/install.sh | sh
```

Authenticate with an API key:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
fuzzy
```

Or use your existing subscription:

```bash
fuzzy
/login  # Then select provider
```

Then just talk to fuzzy. By default, fuzzy gives the model four tools: `read`, `write`, `edit`, and `bash`. The model uses these to fulfill your requests. Add capabilities via [skills](#skills), [prompt templates](#prompt-templates), [extensions](#extensions), or [fuzzy packages](#fuzzy-packages).

**Platform notes:** [Windows](docs/windows.md) | [Termux (Android)](docs/termux.md) | [tmux](docs/tmux.md) | [Terminal setup](docs/terminal-setup.md) | [Shell aliases](docs/shell-aliases.md)

---

## Providers & Models

For each built-in provider, fuzzy maintains a list of tool-capable models, updated with every release. Authenticate via subscription (`/login`) or API key, then select any model from that provider via `/model` (or Ctrl+L).

See [docs/providers.md](docs/providers.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Custom providers & models:** Add providers via `~/.fuzzy/agent/models.json` if they speak a supported API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). For custom APIs or OAuth, use extensions. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) and [docs/custom-provider.md](docs/custom-provider.md).

---

## Interactive Mode

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/interactive-mode.png" alt="Interactive Mode" width="600"></p>

The interface from top to bottom:

- **Startup header** - Shows shortcuts (`/hotkeys` for all), loaded AGENTS.md files, prompt templates, skills, and extensions
- **Messages** - Your messages, assistant responses, tool calls and results, notifications, errors, and extension UI
- **Editor** - Where you type; border color indicates thinking level
- **Footer** - Working directory, session name, total token/cache usage, cost, context usage, current model

The editor can be temporarily replaced by other UI, like built-in `/settings` or custom UI from extensions (e.g., a Q&A tool that lets the user answer model questions in a structured format). [Extensions](#extensions) can also replace the editor, add widgets above/below it, a status line, custom footer, or overlays.

### Editor

| Feature | How |
|---------|-----|
| File reference | Type `@` to fuzzy-search project files |
| Path completion | Tab to complete paths |
| Multi-line | Shift+Enter (or Ctrl+Enter on Windows Terminal) |
| Images | Ctrl+V to paste (Alt+V on Windows), or drag onto terminal |
| Bash commands | `!command` runs and sends output to LLM, `!!command` runs without sending |

Standard editing keybindings for delete word, undo, etc. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

### Commands

Type `/` in the editor to trigger commands. [Extensions](#extensions) can register custom commands, [skills](#skills) are available as `/skill:name`, and [prompt templates](#prompt-templates) expand via `/templatename`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login`, `/logout` | OAuth authentication |
| `/model` | Switch models |
| `/scoped-models` | Enable/disable models for Ctrl+P cycling |
| `/settings` | Thinking level, theme, message delivery, transport |
| `/resume` | Pick from previous sessions |
| `/new` | Start a new session |
| `/name <name>` | Set session display name |
| `/session` | Show session info (file, ID, messages, tokens, cost) |
| `/tree` | Jump to any point in the session and continue from there |
| `/fork` | Create a new session from a previous user message |
| `/clone` | Duplicate the current active branch into a new session |
| `/compact [prompt]` | Manually compact context, optional custom instructions |
| `/copy` | Copy last assistant message to clipboard |
| `/export [file]` | Export session to HTML file |
| `/share` | Upload as private GitHub gist with shareable HTML link |
| `/reload` | Reload keybindings, extensions, skills, prompts, and context files (themes hot-reload automatically) |
| `/hotkeys` | Show all keyboard shortcuts |
| `/changelog` | Display version history |
| `/quit` | Quit fuzzy |

### Keyboard Shortcuts

See `/hotkeys` for the full list. Customize via `~/.fuzzy/agent/keybindings.json`. See [docs/keybindings.md](docs/keybindings.md).

**Commonly used:**

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl+C | Clear editor |
| Ctrl+C twice | Quit |
| Escape | Cancel/abort |
| Escape twice | Open `/tree` |
| Ctrl+L | Open model selector |
| Ctrl+P / Shift+Ctrl+P | Cycle scoped models forward/backward |
| Shift+Tab | Cycle thinking level |
| Ctrl+O | Collapse/expand tool output |
| Ctrl+T | Collapse/expand thinking blocks |

### Message Queue

Submit messages while the agent is working:

- **Enter** queues a *steering* message, delivered after the current assistant turn finishes executing its tool calls
- **Alt+Enter** queues a *follow-up* message, delivered only after the agent finishes all work
- **Escape** aborts and restores queued messages to editor
- **Alt+Up** retrieves queued messages back to editor

On Windows Terminal, `Alt+Enter` is fullscreen by default. Remap it in [docs/terminal-setup.md](docs/terminal-setup.md) so fuzzy can receive the follow-up shortcut.

Configure delivery in [settings](docs/settings.md): `steeringMode` and `followUpMode` can be `"one-at-a-time"` (default, waits for response) or `"all"` (delivers all queued at once). `transport` selects provider transport preference (`"sse"`, `"websocket"`, or `"auto"`) for providers that support multiple transports.

---

## Sessions

Sessions are stored as JSONL files with a tree structure. Each entry has an `id` and `parentId`, enabling in-place branching without creating new files. See [docs/session-format.md](docs/session-format.md) for file format.

### Management

Sessions auto-save to `~/.fuzzy/agent/sessions/` organized by working directory.

```bash
fuzzy -c                  # Continue most recent session
fuzzy -r                  # Browse and select from past sessions
fuzzy --no-session        # Ephemeral mode (don't save)
fuzzy --name "my task"    # Set session display name at startup
fuzzy --session <path|id> # Use specific session file or ID
fuzzy --fork <path|id>    # Fork specific session file or ID into a new session
```

Use `/session` in interactive mode to see the current session ID before reusing it with `--session <id>` or `--fork <id>`.

### Branching

**`/tree`** - Navigate the session tree in-place. Select any previous point, continue from there, and switch between branches. All history preserved in a single file.

- Search by typing, fold/unfold and jump between branches with Ctrl+←/Ctrl+→ or Alt+←/Alt+→, page with ←/→
- Filter modes (Ctrl+O): default → no-tools → user-only → labeled-only → all
- Press Shift+L to label entries as bookmarks and Shift+T to toggle label timestamps

**`/fork`** - Create a new session file from a previous user message on the active branch. Opens a selector, copies the active path up to that point, and places the selected prompt in the editor for modification.

**`/clone`** - Duplicate the current active branch into a new session file at the current position. The new session keeps the full active-path history and opens with an empty editor.

**`--fork <path|id>`** - Fork an existing session file or partial session UUID directly from the CLI. This copies the full source session into a new session file in the current project.

### Compaction

Long sessions can exhaust context windows. Compaction summarizes older messages while keeping recent ones.

**Manual:** `/compact` or `/compact <custom instructions>`

**Automatic:** Enabled by default. Triggers on context overflow (recovers and retries) or when approaching the limit (proactive). Configure via `/settings` or `settings.json`.

Compaction is lossy. The full history remains in the JSONL file; use `/tree` to revisit. Customize compaction behavior via [extensions](#extensions). See [docs/compaction.md](docs/compaction.md) for internals.

---

## Settings

Use `/settings` to modify common options, or edit JSON files directly:

| Location | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| `~/.fuzzy/agent/settings.json` | Global (all projects) |
| `.fuzzy/settings.json` | Project (overrides global) |

See [docs/settings.md](docs/settings.md) for all options.

### Telemetry and update checks

Fuzzy has two separate startup features:

- **Update check:** fetches `https://fuzzyos.com/api/latest-version` to check whether a newer Fuzzy version exists. Disable it with `FUZZY_SKIP_VERSION_CHECK=1`. Disabling update checks only turns off this check.
- **Install/update telemetry:** after first install or a changelog-detected update, sends an anonymous version ping to `https://fuzzyos.com/api/report-install`. This setting also controls optional provider attribution headers for OpenRouter, Cloudflare, and direct NVIDIA NIM requests. Opt out by setting `enableInstallTelemetry` to `false` in `settings.json`, or by setting `FUZZY_TELEMETRY=0`. This does not disable update checks; Fuzzy may still contact `fuzzyos.com` for the latest version unless update checks are disabled or offline mode is enabled.

Use `--offline` or `FUZZY_OFFLINE=1` to disable all startup network operations described here, including update checks, package update checks, and install/update telemetry.

---

## Context Files

Fuzzy loads `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) at startup from:
- `~/.fuzzy/agent/AGENTS.md` (global)
- Parent directories (walking up from cwd)
- Current directory

Use for project instructions, conventions, common commands. All matching files are concatenated.

Disable context file loading with `--no-context-files` (or `-nc`).

### System Prompt

Replace the default system prompt with `.fuzzy/SYSTEM.md` (project) or `~/.fuzzy/agent/SYSTEM.md` (global). Append without replacing via `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`.

---

## Customization

### Prompt Templates

Reusable prompts as Markdown files. Type `/name` to expand.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.fuzzy/agent/prompts/review.md -->
Review this code for bugs, security issues, and performance problems.
Focus on: {{focus}}
```

Place in `~/.fuzzy/agent/prompts/`, `.fuzzy/prompts/`, or a [fuzzy package](#fuzzy-packages) to share with others. See [docs/prompt-templates.md](docs/prompt-templates.md).

### Skills

On-demand capability packages following the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io). Invoke via `/skill:name` or let the agent load them automatically.

```markdown
<!-- ~/.fuzzy/agent/skills/my-skill/SKILL.md -->
# My Skill
Use this skill when the user asks about X.

## Steps
1. Do this
2. Then that
```

Place in `~/.fuzzy/agent/skills/`, `~/.agents/skills/`, `.fuzzy/skills/`, or `.agents/skills/` (from `cwd` up through parent directories) or a [fuzzy package](#fuzzy-packages) to share with others. See [docs/skills.md](docs/skills.md).

### Extensions

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/doom-extension.png" alt="Doom Extension" width="600"></p>

TypeScript modules that extend fuzzy with custom tools, commands, keyboard shortcuts, event handlers, and UI components.

```typescript
export default function (fuzzy: ExtensionAPI) {
  fuzzy.registerTool({ name: "deploy", ... });
  fuzzy.registerCommand("stats", { ... });
  fuzzy.on("tool_call", async (event, ctx) => { ... });
}
```

The default export can also be `async`. fuzzy waits for async extension factories before startup continues, which is useful for one-time initialization such as fetching remote model lists before calling `fuzzy.registerProvider()`.

**What's possible:**
- Custom tools (or replace built-in tools entirely)
- Sub-agents and plan mode
- Custom compaction and summarization
- Permission gates and path protection
- Custom editors and UI components
- Status lines, headers, footers
- Git checkpointing and auto-commit
- SSH and sandbox execution
- MCP server integration
- Make fuzzy look like Claude Code
- Games while waiting (yes, Doom runs)
- ...anything you can dream up

Place in `~/.fuzzy/agent/extensions/`, `.fuzzy/extensions/`, or a [fuzzy package](#fuzzy-packages) to share with others. See [docs/extensions.md](docs/extensions.md) and [examples/extensions/](examples/extensions/).

### Themes

Built-in: `dark`, `light`. Themes hot-reload: modify the active theme file and fuzzy immediately applies changes.

Place in `~/.fuzzy/agent/themes/`, `.fuzzy/themes/`, or a [fuzzy package](#fuzzy-packages) to share with others. See [docs/themes.md](docs/themes.md).

### Fuzzy Packages

Bundle and share extensions, skills, prompts, and themes via npm or git. Find packages on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Afuzzyos) or [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1487106319734276106/1487106320212557826).

> **Security:** Fuzzy packages run with full system access. Extensions execute arbitrary code, and skills can instruct the model to perform any action including running executables. Review source code before installing third-party packages.

```bash
fuzzy install npm:@foo/fuzzy-tools
fuzzy install npm:@foo/fuzzy-tools@1.2.3      # pinned version
fuzzy install git:github.com/user/repo
fuzzy install git:github.com/user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
fuzzy install git:git@github.com:user/repo
fuzzy install git:git@github.com:user/repo@v1  # tag or commit
fuzzy install https://github.com/user/repo
fuzzy install https://github.com/user/repo@v1      # tag or commit
fuzzy install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo
fuzzy install ssh://git@github.com/user/repo@v1    # tag or commit
fuzzy remove npm:@foo/fuzzy-tools
fuzzy uninstall npm:@foo/fuzzy-tools          # alias for remove
fuzzy list
fuzzy update                               # update fuzzy and packages (skips pinned packages)
fuzzy update --extensions                  # update packages only
fuzzy update --self                        # update fuzzy only
fuzzy update --self --force                # reinstall fuzzy even if current
fuzzy update npm:@foo/fuzzy-tools             # update one package
fuzzy config                               # enable/disable extensions, skills, prompts, themes
```

Packages install to `~/.fuzzy/agent/git/` (git) or `~/.fuzzy/agent/npm/` (npm). Use `-l` for project-local installs (`.fuzzy/git/`, `.fuzzy/npm/`). Git `@ref` values are pinned tags or commits; pinned packages are skipped by `fuzzy update`, so use `fuzzy install git:host/user/repo@new-ref` to move an existing package to a new ref. Git packages install dependencies with `npm install --omit=dev` by default, so runtime deps must be listed under `dependencies`; when `npmCommand` is configured, git packages use plain `install` for compatibility with wrappers. If you use a Node version manager and want package installs to reuse a stable npm context, set `npmCommand` in `settings.json`, for example `["mise", "exec", "node@20", "--", "npm"]`.

Create a package by adding a `fuzzy` key to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-fuzzy-package",
  "keywords": ["fuzzy-package"],
  "fuzzy": {
    "extensions": ["./extensions"],
    "skills": ["./skills"],
    "prompts": ["./prompts"],
    "themes": ["./themes"]
  }
}
```

Without a `fuzzy` manifest, fuzzy auto-discovers from conventional directories (`extensions/`, `skills/`, `prompts/`, `themes/`).

See [docs/packages.md](docs/packages.md).

## Programmatic Usage

### SDK

```typescript
import { AuthStorage, createAgentSession, ModelRegistry, SessionManager } from "@fuzzyos/fuzzy-code";

const authStorage = AuthStorage.create();
const modelRegistry = ModelRegistry.create(authStorage);
const { session } = await createAgentSession({
  sessionManager: SessionManager.inMemory(),
  authStorage,
  modelRegistry,
});

await session.prompt("What files are in the current directory?");
```

For advanced multi-session runtime replacement, use `createAgentSessionRuntime()` and `AgentSessionRuntime`.

See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) and [examples/sdk/](examples/sdk/).

### RPC Mode

For non-Node.js integrations, use RPC mode over stdin/stdout:

```bash
fuzzy --mode rpc
```

RPC mode uses strict LF-delimited JSONL framing. Clients must split records on `\n` only. Do not use generic line readers like Node `readline`, which also split on Unicode separators inside JSON payloads.

See [docs/rpc.md](docs/rpc.md) for the protocol.

---

## Philosophy

Fuzzy is aggressively extensible so it doesn't have to dictate your workflow. Features that other tools bake in can be built with [extensions](#extensions), [skills](#skills), or installed from third-party [fuzzy packages](#fuzzy-packages). This keeps the core minimal while letting you shape fuzzy to fit how you work.

**No MCP.** Build CLI tools with READMEs (see [Skills](#skills)), or build an extension that adds MCP support.

**No sub-agents.** There's many ways to do this. Spawn fuzzy instances via tmux, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package that does it your way.

**No permission popups.** Run in a container, or build your own confirmation flow with [extensions](#extensions) inline with your environment and security requirements.

**No plan mode.** Write plans to files, or build it with [extensions](#extensions), or install a package.

**No built-in to-dos.** They confuse models. Use a TODO.md file, or build your own with [extensions](#extensions).

**No background bash.** Use tmux. Full observability, direct interaction.
